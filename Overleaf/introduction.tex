\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of our project is to create a fully functional till system for the Cellar Bar and Restaurant the chosen languages to accomplish this task were PHP and JavaScript for the coding while using My-SQL as the back-end database for the project.[Scope part here]. Initially setting out it took the two of us some time to set a scope for the project as we were not certain on which coding languages to use as well as the back-end database. PHP was chosen as it was a relatively new language to us in light of that we thought it would be good to try something new and broaden our own knowledge on the language. Once the languages were sorted out. The task to set out a project scope that we could use and follow begun, some of the base requirements we decided on at the time were that the POS needed a template for php (front end - back end), user authentication (login ect), management accounts for the boss or managers, types of food / drink being "sold" at restaurant ( how to have set up database with both of these ), have items as products (what makes a product? - name , id , price , ect) adding/deleting editing (CRUD), adding a type of loyalty system or adding users to the system for deals on next purchases (CRUD on them too). have a gui till face, able to be placed onto a tablet for the server, have the sales gui (till front end) create reports that can be looked over in the future. Create a payment method , add tax to a sale depending on the type of category sale is tax will vary. add some sort of external hardware eg a ticket printer or barcode scanner or a card reader machine (if can get hands on one). Most of the the previously listed demands are achievable with what we have on hand other than some of the end hardware that we can hopefully acquire as we go along with the project. Some of the major constraints of the project that may take up a lot of time , initially setting up all CRUD architecture and all the routeing in the project , linking database , a method of payment , adding tax that is changed depending on the category of item. getting the sales from the till front end to be displayed on a sales page for management to access and determine the state of the business. We believe that within the given time frame all that was set out to be done should be realistcally possible, in the case of time catching up on us some features that are not essential to the essence of the project such as the extra hardware that is planned to be added at the end of the project (barcode scanner. printer, cardmachine), loyalty system for customers and having multiple different methods of payment can be dropped as they are not essential to the project itself. (NEXT add constraints that we have identified on the way an things that we had to CHANGE)
